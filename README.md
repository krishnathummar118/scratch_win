Welcome to the "Scratch & Win" Flutter App!

This open-source Flutter app is designed to provide a fun and interactive way for users to engage with digital scratch cards. Users can virtually scratch off the surface of cards to reveal hidden content, such as discounts, prizes, or special messages. It's a great way to gamify your mobile app and create an engaging user experience.
